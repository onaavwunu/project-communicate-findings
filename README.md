> ● Home owners are more likely to take loans and complete their loan payments.

> ● People who are employed take more loans and are more likely to complete their loan     payments.

> ● Listings with a Prosper Score of 4 are mostly under the 'current' loan status         category and listings with a score of 8 have more completed payments. Listings         with   higher risk (higher ProsperScore) are more likely to have completed loan       payments

> ● High income earners complete their loan payments but they make an almost               insubstantial part of the data set. More low income earners take more and higher       lows and it is unclear how this affects their loan status.

> ● Although listings under 10,000 with 'completed' as LoanStatus, it is not a clear       indication that lower LoanOriginalAmount are more like to get paid off
